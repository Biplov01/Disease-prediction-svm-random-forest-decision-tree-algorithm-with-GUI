# (Disease Prediction App with 3 different ML Algorithms)

In this project we ve created a python application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter. 

The application calculates with an accurate percentage (which is shown on the terminal and not on the GUI) the disease that a patient might have, based on the symptoms that he/she provides! 
The 3 algorithms used for prediction are:

* [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
* [SupportVectorMachines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support Vector Machines)
* [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)
